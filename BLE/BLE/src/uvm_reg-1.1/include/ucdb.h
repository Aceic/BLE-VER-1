/*******************************************************************************
* Unified Coverage Database Organization
*
* UCDB files are organized into two sections.
*
* The first section contains information about the test or set of tests that
* were used to generate the coverage data.  Multiple test records should be in
* the database when the file has been created from a merge of multiple
* databases.
*
* The second section contains the coverage data, organized in a hierarchy of
* scopes related to the design, testbench, and test plan.
*
*
* TEST
*
* When first writing to the database, define information about the test from
* which coverage data is acquired.  In addition to a fixed list of fields, any
* of which may be NULL or unused, there are user-defined attributes.
*
* -----------------------------------------------------------------
*  Name | SimTime | Units | CPUTime | Seed | TestArgs | Attrs
* -----------------------------------------------------------------
*  Str  | double  | Str   | Double  | Str  | Str      | Ptr

* Name:     Name of the coverage test
* SimTime:  Simulation time for completion of the test
* Units:    Units for simulation time ("fs", "ps", "ns", "us", "ms", "sec",
*           "min", "hr")
*           NOTE: in QuestaSim, the $Now TCL variable contains current
*           simulation time in a string of this form
* CPUTime:  CPU time for completion of the test.
*           NOTE: in QuestaSim, the "simstats" command can return CPU time.
* Seed:     Randomization seed for the test, should be the seed value provided
*           by the "-sv_seed" vsim option.
* TestArgs: Arguments used to run test, could be used to capture "knob settings"
*           for parameterizable tests, as well as name of test script.
*           Also known as "Command".
* Attrs:    Other user-defined attributes, see type definition below.
* Date:     time of the start of simulation -- if created by QuestaSim, it is a
*           string like "20060105160030" for 4:00:30 PM January 5, 2006: output
*           of strftime with format "%Y%m%d%H%M%S"
* SimArgs:  Simulator command line arguments, can be picked up automatically.
* User:     The user's ID who had run the test.
* Compulsory: Whether this should be considered a compulsory or "must run"
*           test.
* Comment:  String saved by user associated with test (description)
* Status:   Status of test: fatal error ($fatal was called), error ($error was
*           called), warning ($warning was called) or OK.
* Filename: This is the database filename that the test was originally written
*           to.
*
*
* NODES IN THE DATABASE
*
* The coverage database is a tree of nodes (called scopes) in general
* corresponding to design hierarchy.  All nodes except the root node have a
* pointer to their parent.  If design hierarchy is not relevant to coverage, it
* need not be represented in the UCDB.
*
* Nodes may have children, other scope nodes or coverage items.  Design units
* (e.g., Verilog module types or VHDL architectures) are represented as scopes,
* too.  This is because sometimes coverage is represented for the design unit,
* as a union of the coverage of all instances of the design unit.  As written
* by QuestaSim, only code coverage is represented underneath the design unit.
* Note that design units with a single instance in the design are not stored;
* only the instance is stored.
*
* Coverage items are always children of a particular scope.  Coverage items are
* only accessible through their parent scope; this allows optimizations related
* to efficiently storing a set of coverage items that always lie in a certain
* scope.
*
* Scope nodes may represent:
*   *   Design hierarchy: instances of modules, function scope, packages, etc.
*   *   Hierarchy for coverage counts: e.g., a scope to contain different
*       counts for expression rows in expression coverage; scopes to represent
*       SystemVerilog covergroups.  If there is no coverage hierarchy (e.g.,
*       with statement coverage) none is used.  See nesting rules below.
*   *   Test plan items.  These are optional, but are required for some use
*       models of test traceability analysis.  In particular, if you want the
*       UCDB to represent associations between test plan items and coverage
*       items using built-in "tags" -- see *Tag*() functions below -- then test
*       plan item scope should exist in the database.
*
* A coveritem is a single count or vector of bits, generally used to compute
* coverage, represented in the database.  In some coverage models -- e.g.,
* SystemVerilog covergroups -- these represent "bins", but have been expanded
* to represent more types of coverage data.
*
* A coveritem is always accessed through a handle to its parent scope, and an
* index uniquely identifying it within the scope.  One may always query of a
* scope how many coveritems it contains.
*
* NESTING RULES
*
* The UCDB does some light enforcement of HDL nesting rules.  Nesting rules
* are more strictly enforced for coverage scopes, coveritems, and testplan
* scopes. The "covergroup" scopes are for generic use; in fact, coverage
* hierarchy for the UCDB could have been built using "covergroup" scopes only
* -- COVERGROUP, COVERINSTANCE, COVERPOINT, and CROSS -- but for clarity
* different types of coverage (assertion, statement, FSM, etc.) are given their
* own coverage scopes.
*
* The following rules define what nesting rules are enforced by the UCDB:
*
* HDL SCOPE can contain any of:
*   HDL SCOPE, COVER SCOPE, STANDALONE COVERITEM
*
* HDL SCOPE is one of the scope types:
*   UCDB_INSTANCE, UCDB_PACKAGE, UCDB_PROGRAM, UCDB_PACKAGE, UCDB_INTERFACE,
*   UCDB_PROCESS, UCDB_GENERATE, UCDB_TASK, UCDB_FUNCTION, UCDB_FORKJOIN,
*   UCDB_BLOCK, UCDB_CLASS, UCDB_GENERIC
*
* UCDB_INSTANCE contains a "DU" (design unit) or "type" pointer to one of:
*   UCDB_DU_MODULE, UCDB_DU_ARCH
*
* UCDB_PACKAGE contains a "DU" (design unit) or "type" pointer to a:
*   UCDB_DU_PACKAGE
*
* UCDB_PROGRAM contains a "DU" (design unit) or "type" pointer to a:
*   UCDB_DU_PROGRAM
*
* UCDB_INTERFACE contains a "DU" (design unit) or "type" pointer to a:
*   UCDB_DU_INTERFACE
*
* DU SCOPES (UCDB_DU_*) may contain:
*   code coverage coveritems
*   (This can be enhanced to include other subscopes or other types of
*   coveritems, if the database is to be organized to include easily accessible
*   design-unit-based aggregation of data.)
*
* COVER SCOPE is one of the scope types:
*   UCDB_COVERGROUP, UCDB_COVERINSTANCE, UCDB_COVERPOINT, UCDB_CROSS,
*   UCDB_BRANCH, UCDB_EXPR, UCDB_COND, UCDB_TOGGLE, UCDB_FSM,
*   UCDB_ASSERT, UCDB_COVER
*
* STANDALONE COVERITEM is one of the coveritem types:
*   UCDB_STMTBIN, UCDB_USERBIN, UCDB_COUNT
*
* UCDB_TESTPLAN scope can contain only:
*   UCDB_TESTPLAN scope
*
* SystemVerilog covergroup, transaction coverage, user-defined, and
* miscellaneous coverage scope rules:
*
* UCDB_COVERGROUP scope can contain the scope types:
*   UCDB_COVERINSTANCE, UCDB_COVERPOINT, UCDB_CROSS
*
* UCDB_CROSS scope must refer to at least two scopes of type UCDB_COVERPOINT,
* which must have the same parent as the UCDB_CROSS.
*
* UCDB_COVERPOINT scope can contain only:
*   UCDB_CVGBIN coveritems
*   UCDB_ILLEGALBIN coveritems
*   UCDB_IGNOREBIN coveritems
*   UCDB_DEFAULT coveritems
*   Note: UCDB_DEFAULT may be ORed with each of the other bin types to indicate
*   a default bin of the given type.
*
* UCDB_CROSS scope can contain only:
*   UCDB_CVGBIN coveritems
*   UCDB_ILLEGALBIN coveritems
*   UCDB_IGNOREBIN coveritems
*   UCDB_DEFAULT coveritems
*
* UCDB_COVERINSTANCE can contain the scope types:
*   UCDB_COVERPOINT, UCDB_CROSS
*
* SystemVerilog assert and cover objects:
*
* UCDB_ASSERT scope must contain:
*   1 each of coveritems:
*   UCDB_ASSERTBIN
*   no more than 1 of these optional coveritems:
*   UCDB_VACUOUSBIN, UCDB_DISABLEDBIN, UCDB_ATTEMPTSBIN, UCDB_ACTIVEBIN,
*   UCDB_PEAKACTIVEBIN, UCDB_PASSBIN
*   (Note: UCDB_ASSERTBIN indicates assertion failures.  PASSBIN counts toward
*   aggregated coverage.)
*
* UCDB_COVER scope must contain:
*   1 each of coveritems:
*   UCDB_COVERBIN
*   (Note: UCDB_COVERBIN indicates non-vacuous coverage passes or successes.)
*
* Code coverage:
*
* UCDB_STMTBIN may appear in any HDL scope
*
* UCDB_BRANCH scope must contain only:
*   UCDB_BRANCHBIN coveritems
*
* UCDB_EXPR node is used in a 3-level hierarchy:
*   UCDB_EXPR top node contains name and source info
*       UCDB_EXPR second-level nodes are named "FEC" and "UDP" for different
*           representations of expression coverage
*           UCDB_EXPRBIN coveritems
*           Note: coveritem name is description of the expression truth table
*           row.
*
* UCDB_COND node is used in a 3-level hierarchy:
*   UCDB_COND top node contains name and source info
*       UCDB_COND second-level nodes are named "FEC" and "UDP" for different
*           representations of condition coverage
*           UCDB_CONDBIN coveritems
*           Note: coveritem name is description of the condition truth table
*           row.
*
* UCDB_TOGGLE scope must contain:
*   UCDB_TOGGLEBIN coveritems
*   Note: coveritem name is name of toggle transition
*   Note: for extended toggles, coveritems 0 and 1 are the lh, hl transitions,
*   and coveritems 2-5 are the z transitions.
*   Note: toggle nodes, because of their abundance, are lighter-weight
*   structures than all other types in the database, lacking some data that
*   other scopes have.  Exceptions are noted in comments below.
*
* UCDB_FSM scope must contain:
*   2 subscopes: UCDB_FSM_STATES, UCDB_FSM_TRANS
*
* UCDB_FSM_STATES, UCDB_FSM_TRANS scopes must contain:
*   UCDB_FSMBIN coveritems
*

 *      - This is the option.goal or type_option.goal of the object.
 *  GOAL: float
 *      - Optionally used on other types of scopes, an arbitrary goal that can
 *        have an effect (as for TESTPLAN scopes) in GUIs or reports.
 *  ATLEAST: int
 *      - Used on SV covergroup, coverpoint or cross scopes.

 *        1: default merge, test data is merged, the union of bins are merged,
 *           with integer counts incremented and vector counts ORed.
 *        2: tests are associated with most bins as a bit vector (see TESTS
 *           attribute above, and "Associating tests and bins" below)
 *           indicating what test caused them to be covered.  For vector bins,
 *           this means non-zero.  For UCDB_COVER scopes, this means cover
 *           count > at_least; for UCDB_ASSERT scopes, this means fail count >
 *           0; for UCDB_TOGGLE scopes, this means all bins covered (>0) except
 *           for UCDB_TOGGLE_ENUM types, where individual bins >0.
 *           Also: NUMSAMPLED attributes for UCDB_COVERGROUP and
 *           UCDB_COVERINSTANCE scopes are combined into a binary attribute
 *           called "SAMPLED" that is an array of as many integers as there are
 *           tests.
 *
 *  TAGCMD: string: UCDB_TESTPLAN scopes only, semicolon-separated arguments to
 *          Questa "coverage tag" command
 *      - This supports implicit tagging during merge, so as to associate test
 *        plans with coverage for test traceability
 *
 *  SECTION: string: UCDB_TESTPLAN scopes only, section number within test
 *           plan.
 *
 *  COV: float: any scope.  Used in some circumstances by coverage analysis to
 *       cache a computed total coverage number.

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Source File Information
 *
 *  Every UCDB object can potentially have a source file name stored with it.
 *  Different applications have different requirements for how these are
 *  stored, and the UCDB needs to be able to accommodate all of those.
 *  Consequently, the UCDB contains something called a "file handle".  This is
 *  a way of storing an indirect reference to the file name.
 *
 *  For individual coveritems, the UCDB never stores the file name itself, it
 *  stores a reference -- just a number, an offset into some table of file name
 *  strings that must reside elsewhere.  This is for space efficiency, while
 *  retaining the time efficiency of looking up file names.  The UCDB API is
 *  flexible enough that you can let the UCDB itself maintain a file name table
 *  for you -- or if you are exporting to a UCDB from an application that
 *  already has its own file name tables, you can efficiently transfer your own
 *  file name tables and your own offsets (file numbers) directly into the
 *  UCDB.
 *
 *
 *  Simple Use Models
 *
 *  If you don't care about file names and line numbers at all, you can create
 *  objects with NULL for the ucdbSourceInfoT argument, e.g.:
 *
 *      mycover = ucdb_CreateNextCover(db,parent,name,&coverdata,NULL);
 *
 *  If you care about file names but don't care how file names are stored, the
 *  simplest thing to do is create a file handle by name like so:
 *
 *      ucdbSourceInfoT sourceinfo;
 *      status = ucdb_CreateSrcFileHandleByName(db,
 *                                           &source_info.filehandle,
 *                                           NULL,
 *                                           filename,
 *                                           fileworkdir);
 *      source_info.line = myline;
 *      source_info.token = mytoken;
 *
 *      (void) ucdb_CreateNextCover(db,parent,name,&coverdata,&sourceinfo);
 *
 *  This will create a single global look-up table for file names within the
 *  UCDB.  File names will be stored efficiently for each object within the
 *  UCDB, and each unique file name string will be stored only once.
 *
 *  However file names are stored, you can always access the file name with
 *  code like this:
 *
 *      ucdbSourceInfoT sourceinfo;
 *      ucdb_GetCoverData(db,parent,i,&name,&coverdata,&sourceinfo);
 *
 *      if (ucdb_IsValidFileHandle(db,&sourceinfo.filehandle)) {
 *          printf("File name is %s\n",ucdb_GetFileName(db,
 *                                                   &sourceinfo.filehandle));
 *      }
 *
 *
 *  For Third-Party Applications with Existing File Name Tables
 *
 *  Some applications create their own tables of unique file names, and these
 *  tables may be associated with different objects in the design.  For
 *  example, there could be a file look-up table for each design unit.  In
 *  these cases, a UCDB user might like to assume that these tables are correct
 *  by design and transfer them directly into the UCDB through some
 *  corresponding UCDB object (e.g., a design unit scope.)  Then coverage
 *  objects would refer to a file name by the simple and efficient means of an
 *  integer offset in the associated file table.  Again, these would be assumed
 *  correct by construction and the integer values added to the UCDB directly.
 *
 *  In order to avoid complex look-up rules for what file table is valid in a
 *  particular context, the UCDB file handle concept makes the file table
 *  somewhat explicit: that is, the user must declare with which scope the file
 *  table is associated when creating a file handle.  This must be a scope
 *  which is accessible in read streaming or write streaming modes.  The rules
 *  are these:
 *
 *  -   The file table may be in the current scope.
 *  -   The file table may be in an ancestor of the current scope: that means
 *      parent (ucdb_ScopeParent), parent's parent, etc.
 *  -   The file table may be in a design unit.  The UCDB guarantees that file
 *      tables associated with design units are accessible in streaming modes.
 *
 *  By contrast, a sibling node
 *  (ucdb_NextSubScope(db,parent,myself,UCDB_ALL_SCOPES)) or child node
 *  (ucdb_NextSubScope(db,myself,NULL,UCDB_ALL_SCOPES)) would be illegal,
 *  because these nodes would not be available in streaming modes.  The same
 *  goes for "cousin" nodes or "nephew/niece" nodes, etc..
 *
 *  When an application has its own file tables, they must be transferred into
 *  the UCDB so it can know what file names are being used:
 *
 *      foreach entry in file name table:
 *          ucdb_SrcFileTableAppend(db,
 *                                  &new_file_handle,
 *                                  ucdb_scope_for_filetable,
 *                                  filename,
 *                                  fileworkdir);
 *
 *  If needed, file tables can be dumped with the ucdb_FileTableSize() and
 *  ucdb_FileTableName() functions.
 *
 *  To directly transfer file numbers into the UCDB, this technique can be
 *  used:
 *
 *      ucdbFileHandleT filehandle;
 *      ucdbSourceInfoT sourceinfo;
 *
 *      //
 *      // This filehandle retains a reference to the "current" file table.
 *      // Note that entry 0 is guaranteed to exist because file tables always
 *      // have at least 1 entry in them if they exist at all:
 *      //
 *      status = ucdb_CreateFileHandleByNum(db,
 *                                          &filehandle,
 *                                          scope_with_filetable,
 *                                          0);
 *
 *      //
 *      // Now you create a file handle with the file number (file table
 *      // offset) particular to the object being stored, while retaining the
 *      // previous reference to the "current" file table:
 *      //
 *      foreach coverage object:
 *          ucdb_CloneFileHandle(db,filehandle,
 *                               &sourceinfo.filehandle,
 *                               object.filenum);
 *          sourceinfo.line = object.linenum;
 *          sourceinfo.token = object.tokennum;
 *          ucdb_CreateNextCover(db,scope,name,&coverdata,&sourceinfo);
 *
 *  This scheme directly transfers file tables and file numbers (file table
 *  offsets) from the third-party tool into the UCDB.  It remains time
 *  efficient because no string-based look-up is ever done.  On retrieval, if
 *  you want access to the original file number, use ucdb_GetFileNum().  For
 *  access to the UCDB file table referenced by a file handle, use
 *  ucdb_GetFileTableScope().
 *
 *
 *  Note that because ucdbFileHandleT is defined as a struct, variables of type
 *  ucdbFileHandleT can be copied.  It is not recommended that the API user
 *  access the structure members directly, as the struct historys may change in
 *  the future for a yet more efficient implementation.  There are access
 *  functions for every type of operation to be done with file handles.

/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Database creation and file management
 *
 *  The database exists in two forms potentially: an in-memory image accessible
 *  with a database handle, and a persistent form on the filesystem.  There are
 *  "read streaming" and "write streaming" modes that minimize the memory usage
 *  in the current process.  The streaming modes keep only a small "window" of
 *  data in memory, and once you have moved onward in reading or writing, you
 *  cannot revisit earlier parts of the database; random access is not
 *  possible.
 *
 *  Opening a file, creating an in-memory image
 *
 *  Reading from a persistent database and creating an in-memory image are
 *  combined in the same function: ucdb_Open(), which always creates a valid
 *  database handle.  If a filename is given to ucdb_Open(), the in-memory
 *  image is populated from the persistent database in the named file.
 *
 *  Note on constant-time access to summary statistics:
 *
 *  From Questa 6.3d onward, some parts of the data model can be accessed
 *  without fully populating the in-memory data image, if and only if no other
 *  calls have been made since ucdb_Open() that require accessing the in-memory
 *  image.  This allows some data to be accessed in constant time regardless of
 *  the size of the UCDB:
 *      * ucdb_CalcCoverageSummary with scope==NULL and test_mask==NULL
 *      * ucdb_GetCoverage
 *      * ucdb_GetStatistics
 *      * ucdb_GetMemoryStats
 *
 *  Writing to a file from an in-memory image
 *
 *  This may be done at any time with the ucdb_Write() function.  This
 *  transfers all of or a subset of the in-memory image to the named persistent
 *  database file, overwriting the file if it previously existed.
 *
 *  Deleting the in-memory image
 *
 *  This is done with the ucdb_Close() function.  After this, the database
 *  handle is no longer valid.
 *
 *  Using write streaming mode
 *
 *  If wanting to create a UCDB with minimal memory overhead, create a UCDB
 *  handle with ucdb_OpenWriteStream().  This creates a UCDB handle whose use
 *  is restricted.  In particular, there is a prescribed order in which objects
 *  must be created:
 *      * Create UCDB attributes first.
 *        Note: creation of UCDB attributes at the beginning of the file is not
 *        enforced; this allows the case of UCDB attributes created at the end
 *        of the output -- which might be necessary for attributes whose values
 *        must be computed as a result of traversing the data during write.
 *      * Create TestData.
 *      * Create scopes, creating DU scopes before corresponding instance
 *        scopes.
 *      * If a scope contains coverage items, create those first.
 *      * If a scope contains child scopes, create those after coveritems.
 *  There are other restrictions as well; see comments for individual
 *  functions, below.  For example, accessing immediate ancestors is OK, but
 *  accessing siblings is not (nor is it OK to access an ancestor's siblings.)
 *  Furthermore, the function ucdb_WriteStream() must be used -- and may only be
 *  used -- in write streaming mode to finish writing a particular object, and
 *  ucdb_WriteStreamScope() used to finish writing a scope and resume writing
 *  the parent scope.
 *  In write streaming mode, the ucdb_Close() function must be used to finish
 *  the file being written to and free any temporary memory used for the
 *  database handle.
 *
 *  Using read streaming mode
 *
 *  The read streaming mode operates with callbacks.  The persistent database
 *  is opened with the ucdb_OpenReadStream() call, and control is surrendered
 *  to the UCDB system which will initiate callbacks to the given callback
 *  function.  Along with each callback is given a "reason" (the data which is
 *  valid for this particular callback) and enough information to access the
 *  corresponding data.
 *
 *  Notes on read streaming callback order:
 *
 *      * INITDB is always the first callback.
 *        UCDB attributes created first in write streaming mode are available,
 *        as are UCDB attributes created with in-memory mode.
 *      * all TEST callbacks follow; after the next non-TEST callback
 *        there will be no more TEST callbacks.
 *      * DU callbacks must precede their first associated instance SCOPE
 *        callbacks, but need not immediately precede them.
 *      * SCOPE and DU and CVBIN callbacks can occur in any order
 *        (excepting the DU before first instance rule) -- though
 *        nesting level is implied by the order of callbacks.
 *      * ENDSCOPE callbacks correspond to SCOPE and DU callbacks and
 *        imply a "pop" in the nesting of scopes and design units.
 *      * ENDDB callbacks can be used to access UCDB attributes written at the
 *        end of the file, if created in write streaming modes.

/* #########################################################################
 * ##### USER ATTRIBUTES -- begin
 * ######################################################################### */

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  User-defined attributes
 *
 *  This is a simple set of facilities for providing user-defined attributes
 *  associated with objects in the database -- scopes, coveritems, or tests --
 *  or with the database itself (global attributes).  User-defined attributes
 *  are key-value pairs that may be traversed or looked up by key.
 *
 *  Note on memory management: on reading or writing, values returned are always
 *  ownwd by the API.  They are good until the next call. The memory for keys
 *  is always good.
 *
 *  Note on index given to attribute access functions:
 *
 *  Coveritems are identified by a combination of the parent scope handle
 *  (pointer) and an integer index for the coveritem.  In order to use the
 *  attribute functions for a scope only, the integer index must be set to -1.
 *  For history node objects, the index must always be -1.
 *
 *  When the functions are given an attribute handle, if that handle is of type
 *  UCDB_ATTR_ARRAY, then the index must be a value from 0 to the array size -
 *  1.  The array size may be queried using the ucdb_AttrArraySize() function.
 *  
 *  If the attribute handle is of type UCDB_ATTR_HANDLE, then the index must be
 *  -1.
 *
 *  Deprecated functions:
 *
 *  ucdb_AttrMatch()        did not copy attribute values
 *  ucdb_AttrNext()         did not copy attribute values
 *  
 *  
 *  Example A.
 *  Create an attribute array:
 *  "NAMES",0    -> "bob"
 *  "NAMES",1    -> "fred"
 *
 *  // A1. Create an attribute array handle
 *  ucdbAttrValueT names_array;
 *  names_array.type = UCDB_ATTR_ARRAY;
 *  ucdb_AttrAdd(db,scope,-1,"NAMES",&names_array);
 *
 *  // A2. Use handle (set by API) to create string attribute 0
 *  ucdbAttrValueT name;
 *  name.type = UCDB_ATTR_STRING;
 *  name.u.svalue = "bob";
 *  ucdb_AttrAdd(db,names_array.u.attrhandle,0,NULL,&name);
 *  
 *  // A3. Use handle (set by API) to create string attribute 1
 *  name.type = UCDB_ATTR_STRING;

 *  Managing scopes: design hierarchy and coverage scopes
 *
 *  The database is organized hierarchically, as per the design database: i.e.,
 *  there is a tree of module instances, each of a given module type.
 *
 *  Note on hierarchical identifiers:
 *
 *  If a scope type is Verilog or SystemVerilog, Verilog escaped identifiers
 *  syntax is assumed for a path within that scope.  If a scope type is VHDL,
 *  VHDL extended identifiers may be used.  The escaped identifier syntax
 *  is sensitive to the scope type so that escaped identifiers may appear in
 *  the user's accustomed syntax.
 *
 *  If a scope type is VHDL, entity, architecture, and library may be encoded
 *  in the name.
 *
 *  Note on attributes:
 *
 *  char* attributes may be omitted with a NULL value
 *  int attributes may be omitted with a negative value

 *              scope_mask and cover_mask are applied AFTER recursion.
 *              Recursion proceeds from all scopes matching the (possibly
 *              wildcarded) path, after which callbacks are generated only for
 *              those scopes and covers -- including those specified by the
 *              path itself -- that share a bit with the scope or cover mask.
 *  path        If (du_name==NULL) it is treated as an absolute path.
 *              If (du_name!=NULL) it is treated as a path relative to
 *              design unit(s) matching du_name
 *              If equal to "/" it is treated as "*" (matches all roots or all
 *              paths under a design unit).
 *              Wildcards may be given to match multiple results (see below).
 *              Uses UCDB path separator, escaped identifier rules in a
 *              context-sensitive fashion.
 *  du_name     in format "lib.primary(secondary)", secondary matched for VHDL
 *              only.  Multiple matches possible if lib or secondary is absent
 *              (note this is even true of Verilog design units, if the
 *              simulator created an artificial secondary.)  If path is given
 *              also, then path is relative to all dus matching this
 *              specification.
 *  root_mask   Will only start matching from a root that satisfies 1 bit of
 *              this mask.  This applies at the top-level only, so will not
 *              apply when du_name is given.  Most likely set to UCDB_TESTPLAN
 *              or UCDB_NONTESTPLAN_SCOPE to choose a testplan tree or
 *              non-testplan tree.
 *  scope_mask  Will only match scopes satisfying 1 bit of this mask.
 *  cover_mask  Will only match coveritems satisfying 1 bit of this mask.
 *  cbfunc      User-supplied callback function.  Note that only these callback
 *              reasons (ucdbCBReasonT) are generated:
 *                  UCDB_REASON_DU, UCDB_REASON_SCOPE, UCDB_REASON_CVBIN
 *                  UCDB_REASON_ENDSCOPE
 *
 *
 *  Note on Test Plan Scopes
 *
 *  When recursing through a test plan scope, it is considered to have virtual
 *  children: the design or coverage scopes with which it is linked through
 *  common tags.  This reflects the reality that these scopes contribute to the
 *  test plan scope's coverage.  The same goes for matching "*" children of a
 *  test plan scope: that matches both real test plan children as well as
 *  scopes linked to the test plan scope with tags.
 *
 *  Return Value
 *
 *  -1 with use error, otherwise returns the number of matches (0 or more)
 *
 *  Wildcarding:
 *
 *  *                         matches any substring within a level of hierarchy
 *  ?                         preceding character is optional
 *  [<int>:<int>]             matches an integer index within the range
 *  (<int|*> to <int|*>)      matches an integer index within the range
 *  (<int|*> downto <int|*>)  matches an integer index within the range
 *
 *  More wildcarding characters may be supported in the future.  To match
 *  wildcard characters literally, the appropriate escaped identifier syntax
 *  must be used.
 *
 *  Examples:
 *
 *  ucdb_PathCallBack(db,0,"/top/a*",NULL,UCDB_NONTESTPLAN_SCOPE,
 *                    UCDB_HDL_INST_SCOPE,0,f,d);
 *
 *      Call back for all HDL instance scopes that start with "/top/a".
 *
 *  ucdb_PathCallBack(db,0,NULL,"duname",-1,-1,0,f,d);
 *
 *      Call back for all design units with name "duname".  This may match
 *      multiple architectures or library implementations of the design unit.
 *
 *  ucdb_PathCallBack(db,0,"myvec*","work.duname(myarch)",-1,UCDB_TOGGLE,0,f,d);
 *
 *      Within VHDL architecture "work.duname(myarch)", call back for all toggle
 *      scopes whose names start with "myvec".
 *
 *  ucdb_PathCallBack(db,1,"/top/a",NULL,UCDB_NONTESTPLAN_SCOPE,
 *                    UCDB_COVERGROUP|UCDB_COVERPOINT|UCDB_CROSS,0,f,d);
 *
 *      Call back for all covergroup, cross, and coverpoint scopes that lie
 *      underneath "/top/a".  Only if "/top/a" is a covergroup scope will
 *      "/top/a" itself be a callback.
 *
 *  ucdb_PathCallBack(db,1,"/top/a",NULL,UCDB_NONTESTPLAN_SCOPE,
 *                    UCDB_COVERGROUP|UCDB_COVERPOINT|UCDB_CROSS,UCDB_CVGBIN,

 *  -   For a leaf testplan scope, coverage is the weighted average of all
 *      design instance or coverage scopes sharing the same tag.
 *  -   For a non-leaf testplan scope, coverage is the weighted average of
 *      coverage of all children.  If the non-leaf testplan scope shares a tag

 *      as one child testplan instance -- as if there were a virtual child
 *      testplan scope that shared a tag with all the other design and coverage
 *      scopes.
 *  -   Assertion results are included in the form of "% non-vacuously passed",
